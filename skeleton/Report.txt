- Compile instructions (Same with the "Preparation" section of skeleton's README.md)
    - Add LLVM_HOME to your environment
    - Use CMake and Make to compile our pass to runtime lib
        - mkdir build
        - cd build
        - cmake ..
        - make

- Run instructions (same with the instructions in PDF handout except for the filename of .so file. 
                    Per instructions on Piazza, the filename should be "libilpdep.so" instead of "ilpdep.so")
    - opt OPTARGS -load=libilpdep.so -ilpdep -ilpoutput=output.ilp input.c
